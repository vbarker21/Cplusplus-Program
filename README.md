#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by starting out with a lot of testing. Write small amounts of code and test their functionality 
before moving onto the next portion. This way I am able to catch any errors early and fix them before my code gets too long. I have learned that I shouldn't
hard code things like inputs so the users can experience the software with their own inputs. I would also use an authentication by enforcing strong passwords and account lockout functionality. 

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I would start by interviewing and observing actual or likely users of the product. I would also talk to people who work with similar products or users and review any existing documents. 

#How do I approach designing software?
I would approach designing software by having a clear understanding of my requirements. I then would use agile methology for my development technique. I would brainstorm every component and how to approach it. I would start a piece by piece and put them all together but test regularly and often to make sure that the code that I have already written was functional. I would also have someone else test the functionality of the software during the process to make sure that it is user friendly and I am able to avoid any bias towards my program.
